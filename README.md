# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Data-Mining-Techniques
In this project i tried to identify and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent fallout in predicting studentâ€™s academic performance.
As a result of the lockdown announced after the spread of the virus, many colleges were forced to adapt to online learning tools. For this, a data set of various undergraduate students was
compiled from March 2021. A Likert-type questionnaire was
administered and large number of responses were gathered from
various primary and secondary resources. This was subsequently
used to validate the proposed methodology. Furthermore, different
classification algorithms were applied and compared with
one another based on their performance concerning the said
methodology. The results show that the excessive use of elearning
tools including smartphones, laptops and tablets have
a significant impact on student performance as well as on their
psychological health.
