# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Data-Mining-Techniques
## Introduction
Here, I have tried to identify and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent fallout in predicting student’s academic performance using the Eduction Data Mining (EDM). As a result of the lockdown announced after the spread of the virus, many colleges were forced to adapt to online learning tools. For this, a data set of various undergraduate students was compiled from March 2021. A Likert-type questionnaire was administered and large number of responses were gathered from various primary and secondary resources. This was subsequently used to validate the proposed methodology. Furthermore, different classification algorithms were applied and compared with one another based on their performance concerning the said methodology. The results show that the excessive use of e-learning tools including smartphones, laptops and tablets have a significant impact on student performance as well as on their psychological health.

## Data Mining Techniques used 

1. Decision Tree -
Due to its lesser complexity and simple architecture, decision
trees are widely used in EDM. It consists
of nodes and leaves where data is continuously split in accordance
with certain parameters. Another advantage of decision
tree is that it requires lesser time for data preparation and is
easy to interpret.

2. Random Forests - They on the other hand perform classification
by constructing a number of decision trees at training time
using bootstrapping, random subsets of features and average
voting. It is more robust than decision trees and lesser prone
to overfitting.

3. K-nearest neighbors - It determines the class of the data point through a majority
voting principle. It means that a class label can assigned to
a data point based on it’s distance to it’s nearest neighbors.
Its relatively lesser computation time compared to other classification
techniques and clarity makes it very useful in EDM.

4. Support Vector Machine- It is generally used for smaller datasets and hence perform
relatively faster. In this technique a hyper plane is drawn
which helps to separate two or more different classes. The
decision boundary or Hyperplane is estimated by maximizing
the distance between different groups. The dimension of
the hyperplane depends upon the number of features of the
class. Due to it’s shorter computation time it’s often used to
predict student performance and in other EDM
techniques.
